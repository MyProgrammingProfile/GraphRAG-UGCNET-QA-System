Question No. 1 / Question ID 703002 | Shift - 1
The number 68132 – 31932 is divisible by
1. both 362 and 1000
2. 362 but not 1000
3. 1000 but not 362
4. neither 362 nor 1000

Answer: 1
In the question, look for the unit digit number and the power.
For example, the powers of 9 operate as follows:
91 = 9,
92 = 81,
93 = 729, and so on.
Hence, the power cycle of 9 also contains only 2 numbers 9 & 1, which appear in case of odd and even powers
respectively. While that for 1 raised to any power will result in unit place being 1. When 1 is subtracted with 1 it
results in a 0 at unit place, making the number divisible by both 362 and 1000.

Which one of the following graphs represents the displacement vs time relation for the motion of a ball
thrown upward and returning toward the ground, remaining in air for 10 seconds? (Ignore air resistance.)

Answer: 4
Displacement is a vector quantity and depends on the direction. If an object returns to its original place the net
displacement will be zero. But as the ball gains height it will tend to deaccelerate thus taking more time to
cover the same distance and thus the plot between displacement versus time cannot be sharp as seen in option
A. Thus the answer is option D.

Vehicle number plates have two letters out of the 26 letters of the English alphabet followed by four decimal
digits. How many different number plates are possible if repetition of letters and digits is allowed?
1. 26 × 25 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7
2. 26 × 26 × 10 × 10 × 10 × 10
3. (26 × 25 × 24 × 23 × 10 × 9) / (4 × 3 × 2 × 2)
4. 26 × 25 × 24 × 23 × 10 × 9

Answer: 2
The vehicle number is consisting of total 2+4 = 6 figures. If the repetition is allowed, then at the first two places
the total combinations are 26 x 26. While at the next 4 places are numbers with total of 10 choices. Therefore,
the total possible combinations are 26 x 26 × 10 × 10 × 10 × 10.

In an examination 3 medals were awarded for each of 5 subjects. If three candidates won exactly four
medals each, and no candidate won Just one medal, the total number of medal winners
1. was exactly 4
2. was exactly 5
3. could be either 5 or 6
4. was exactly 6

Answer: 1
three candidates won exactly four medals each, i.e. 3 × 4 = 12
Total number of medals = 3 × 5 = 15
Therefore, remaining medals 15-12 = 3
and, with no candidate winning just one medal, answer cannot be 5 or 6 candidates.

F

Answer: 4
Given: DEFG is a square and ∠BAC=90°.
In ΔAFG and ΔDBG
∠GAF = ∠BDG [90°]
∠AGF = ∠DBG [corresponding angles because GF|| BC and AB is the transversal]
ΔAFG≈ΔDBG [by AA Similarity Criterion] …………(1)
In ΔAGF & ΔEFC
∠AFG = ∠CEF [90°]
∠AFG = ∠ECF [corresponding angles because GF|| BC and AC is the transversal]
ΔAGF≈ΔEFC [by AA Similarity Criterion] …………(2)
From equation 1 and 2.
ΔDBG≈ΔEFC
BD/EF=DG/EC
BD/DE = DE/EC [ DEFG is a square]
DE2=BD×EC. (BD = x and EC = y, Given)
Hence the area of the Square is xy unit

Answer: 2
Here we have to find the minimum number of siblings so that the sum of 12 children can be reached
irrespective of how many brothers and sisters. Also none of the sibling can have a single child, that means that
there are more than 1 brother and sister. If we take answer as 5 considering 3 of one sex and 2 of other, we
have:
Number of children = 3 x 2 + 2 x 3 = 12

Doubled Haploid (DH) populations and Recombinant Inbred Lines (RILs) are two types of populations used in
genetics and plant breeding research. DH populations are created by doubling the chromosome number in a
haploid cell, resulting in an individual that is homozygous at all loci. RILs are generated through several
generations of selfing and sibling mating. The lines are derived from the same initial cross, and each line is
typically homozygous but may differ from each other due to recombination events during the generations.

following statements represents a scenario where monogamy in birds ls LEAST likely to evolve?
1. Poor quality of habitat wherein resources are hard to find
2. Males guard females after mating with them
3. Mates are scattered and hard to find
4. Offspring do not require elaborate parental care

Answer 4
Monogamy in birds often evolves when there is a need for parental care, and both parents contribute to raising
offspring. If offspring do not require elaborate parental care, there may be less pressure for both parents to stay
together.

Which one of the following floral homeotic genes is transcribed in all four whorls during flower development?
1. AP1
2. AP2
3. AP3/PI
4. AG

Answer 2 Incorrect*
In the wild-type flower of Arabidopsis, whorl 1 is determined to be sepals by the product of class A genes (APETALA1 and
APETALA2) alone; whorl 2 is determined as petals by the combined actions of class A genes and class B genes (APETALA3
and PISTILLATA); whorl 3 is determined as stamens by the combined actions of class B genes and class C genes
(AGAMOUS) and whorl 4 is determined as carpels by the action of class C gene alone. Development of the ABC model
contributed greatly to our understanding of floral development. The model has recently been expanded to include five
gene classes (A, B, C, D, E) and is therefore known as the ABCDE model of flower development. The class E genes are
required for the functioning of A-, B- and C- class genes. In Arabidopsis, the class E genes include SEPALLATA 1–4 (SEP 1–4)
genes.

Which one of the following statements is correct for dosage compensation in human?
1. X-chromosome inactivation in female occurs in a zygote immediately after fertilization.
2. X-chromosome inactivation is non-random, in some individuals maternal X is inactivated while in others
paternal X-chromosome is inactivated.
3. Y-chromosome of males is seen as Barr body.
4. The body of female is a mosaic of cells, some having paternal X- and others having maternal X-inactivated.

Answer 4
In humans, females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y chromosome. This difference
in the number of X chromosomes could potentially lead to an imbalance in gene expression if not compensated
for. The process of dosage compensation in humans primarily involves inactivating one of the two X
chromosomes in females. This inactivation is known as X-chromosome inactivation. In each cell of a female's
body, one of the two X chromosomes is randomly inactivated during early embryonic development.

In the production of alcohol by fermentation, in the absence of oxygen, yeasts convert glucose to pyruvate
and pyruvate to ethanol. Fermentation promotes glycolysis by
1. Converting acetaldehyde to alcohol to prevent feed-back inhibition
2. Generating NAOH for mitochondrial ATP generation
3. Preventing toxicity of acetaldehyde
4. Generating NAD+ for glycolysis

Answer 4
During glycolysis, glucose is metabolized to pyruvate, and NAD+ is reduced to NADH. In the absence of oxygen, if
NADH is not regenerated, glycolysis cannot continue because there will be a shortage of NAD+. The
fermentation process, which involves the conversion of pyruvate to ethanol, allows NADH to be oxidized back to
NAD+, ensuring that glycolysis can proceed, and the cells can continue to generate ATP through anaerobic

The statements below attempt to describe a few characteristics of Alu repeats found in the human genome
A. Alu elements are a class of short interspersed elements (SINEs).
B. SINEs are autonomous transposons.
C. Alu repeat originated from cDNA copies of 7SL RNA.
D. Alu repeats have a relatively high AT content.
E. They are preferentially located in the gene-poor G chromosome bands.
Which one of the following options shows combination of all correct statements?
1. A, B and E
2. B, C and D
3. A and C only
4. C and E only
Answer 3
The most common SINES in human genome is Alu elements. Alu elements frequently contain a site for the
restriction enzyme AluI and consequently are called Alu elements. These about 300-bp sequences are scattered
throughout the human genome, constituting ~10 percent of the total DNA. A related transposable element, B1,
is found in the mouse genome. Both of these transposable DNA sequences are thought to have evolved from
the gene for 7SL scRNA, a non coding RNA involved in the movement of the polypeptide in the organelles.

inducing long-term memory ln the brain. The following statements describe the effects of mutations in the
components of the pathway on gene transcription by GREB.
A. Loss of function mutation in a cAMP binding site of the PKA regulatory subunit leads to the inactivation of
gene expression.
B. Activating mutation in the GTP-binding domain of the a subunit of Gs leads to the activation of gene
expression.
C. Inactivating mutation that prevents the regulatory subunit of PKA to bind the catalytic subunit leads to
the activation of gene expression.

Answer 1
Sporophytic apomixis is also referred to as adventitious embryony. The embryo develops directly from
diploid somatic (sporophytic) cells within the ovule. There is no embryo sac formation. Embryos are
formed directly from unreduced cells of the nucellus, or inner integument. In gametophytic apomixis,
functional female gametophyte i.e., embryo sac, develops without meiosis (apomeiosis). Hence, the
embryo sac has the same number of chromosomes as the mother plant. The embryo sac may arise
either from an archesporial cell (megaspore mother cell) or from non-archesporial cell of the nucellus.

In yeast, temperature-sensitive mutants of cell cycle regulators, cdc2 (the key cyclin-dependent kinase), cdc13
(required for telomeric DNA replication), and cdc13 rad9 (that carries an additional mutation in the DNA damage
sensor) were isolated. When grown in non-permissive temperature for a few hours, different phenotypes were
observed in these mutants. Choose the option that correctly describes the most likely phenotype for all of these
mutants.
1. The cdc2 mutants will arrest in G1/S, cdc13 in M and cdc13 rad9 in S-phase.
2. The cdc2 mutants will arrest after a few divisions in G1 , cdc13 in M and cdc13 rad9 in S-phase.
3. The cdc2 mutants will arrest in G1/S, G2 and M, cdc13 in G2 and cdc13 rad9 will continue to divide for a few
generations.
4. The cdc2 mutants will arrest in G1/S, G2 and M, cdc13 in G1 and M and cdc13 rad9 in all phases of the cell cycle.

Answer 3
The cdc2 mutants exhibit a broad cell cycle arrest phenotype, cdc13 mutants specifically arrest in G2, and cdc13
rad9 mutants exhibit a unique phenotype of continued division for a limited number of generations, possibly
due to the influence of the additional DNA damage sensor mutation.

Which one of the following options represents the correct combination of statements?
1. A and B

2. Band C

3. C and D

4. A and D

Answer 3
A and B antigens derive from H antigen. During the formation of A and B antigens, H antigen (encoded by H gene) acts as a
precursor oligosaccharide. An enzyme fucosyltransferase is responsible for the synthesis of H antigen, that adds fucose to a
precursor oligosaccharide. Gene encoding this enzyme is located on the 19th chromosome (19q13.3) in humans and has two
alternative (allelic) forms—H and h. Individuals with genotypes HH or Hh produce H antigen whereas genotype hh do not produce
H antigen. Because the H antigen is an essential precursor to the A and B antigens, individual with genotype hh cannot produce A
and B antigens.

Which one of the following options shows combination of all correct statements?
1. B, C, D
2. C, D, E
3. A and E only
4. B and D only

Answer 2
Involvement of a cis-acting branchpoint site present near 3' end of each exon is essential for splicing: It is not true. The
branchpoint site is not near the 3' end of each exon; rather, it is located within the intron. The branchpoint is typically
an adenosine residue in the intron sequence, and it is essential for the splicing reaction. In the first step of splicing
reaction, 2’-OH of the conserved U at the branch-site acts as a nucleophile to attack the phosphoryl group of the
conserved G in the 5' splice site: It is not true. In the splicing reaction, it is the 2'-OH group of the branchpoint
adenosine (A) that acts as a nucleophile, not a U. The nucleophile attacks the 5' splice site, leading to the formation of a
lariat intermediate and the exon being ligated to the intron.

of their common tangent AB is
1. 6✓3

4.

12 ✓2

Answer: 3
Solution: Let the two circles with centers A and B and radii 4 cm and 9 cm respectively touch each other
externally at a point C.
Then, AB = AC + CB = (4 + 9) cm = 13 cm.
Let PQ be a direct common tangent to the two circles.
Join AP and BQ. Then, AP⊥ PQ and BQ ⊥ PQ.
[Radius through point of contact is perpendicular to the tangent]
Draw, BL ⊥ AP. Then, PLBQ is a rectangle.
Now, LP = BQ = 4 cm and PQ = BL.
AL = (AP - LP) = (9 – 4) cm = 5 cm.
From right triangle ALB, we have
AB2 = AL2 + BL2⇒ BL2 = AB2 − AL2 = (13) 2−(5) 2 = 169 – 25 = 144
⇒BL = √144 = 12 cm.
PQ = BL = 12 cm.
Hence, the length of direct common tangent is 12 cm.

1.

the same as the amount of water in container A

2.

more than the amount of water in container A

3.

less than the amount of water in container A

4.

indeterminable

Answer: 1
Solution:
There are two containers A and B.
A contains 1L of alcohol.
B contains 1L of water.
100 ml of alcohol from X is transferred to Y.
Now, we get,
A → alcohol = 900 ml
B → alcohol = 100 ml and Water = 1000 ml
Total mixture in B is 1100 ml in which ratio of Alcohol and Water is 1:11 respectively.
After that 100 ml of the mixture of B is transferred to A,
Mixture to be transferred from B = B → alcohol = 100/12, Water = (100/12) x 11 = 1100/12
Remaining mixture in B = B → alcohol = 100 - (100/12) = 1100/12, Water = 100 - (1100/12) = 100/12
New Mixture in A = A → Alcohol = 900+ (100/12) = 10900/12, Water = 100/12
the proportion of water in A i.e. 100/12
the proportion of alcohol in B i.e. 100/12
It means the amount of alcohol in container B would be same as the amount of water in container A

Two semicircles are drawn in a square with sides as diameters as shown. If the side of the square is 2 units,
how much is the shaded area (in sq. units)?
1. 2 – π/4
2. 2 – π/3

2 units

3. 3 – π/2
4. 3 – π/4
Answer: 3
Side of the square 2 units (Given)
So, the area of the given square is 4 sq. unit
Now, we divide the large square into 4 equal squares. (Fig. l)
Each small square has the area 1 sq. unit
As we need the area of the shaded region we can remove the unshaded region which does not
contain shaded area (fig.ll)
Area of the new shape is 3 sq unit(fig.ll)
The area of shaded region is 3 – (area of 2 quadrants (a and b))
⇒ 3 - πr2/2 ( r = side of the small square = 1 unit)
⇒ 3 - π/2

While developing genetic maps, Alfred Sturtevant proposed that genetic distances are additive. From
test crosses involving two genes, if the genetic distance between genes A and B was observed to be 15
cM and between B and C was 10 cM, then the percentage of recombinants observed between A and C
would be 25, given that the arrangement is A–B–C. This will be observed only when there is:
1. No interference
2. Complete interference
3. Negative interference
4. Variable interference
Answer 2
Interference refers to the phenomenon where a crossover event in one region of a chromosome affects the
likelihood of a crossover event in an adjacent region. In complete interference, genetic distances between
genes are additive, and the observed percentage of recombinants is the sum of the individual genetic distances.
In this case, if the genetic distance between A and B is 15 cM and between B and C is 10 cM, the expected
percentage of recombinants between A and C would be 25 cM (15 cM + 10 cM).

The mobile signal, florigen, that controls the flowering status of the plants in encoded by which one of the
following?
1. Flowering locus C (FLC)
2. Flowering locus D (FD)
3. Flowering locus T (FT)
4. CONSTANS (CO)
Answer 3
The product of CONSTANS gene, CO protein, activates the transcription of FT gene. FT protein moves from the leaves to
the apical meristem. Once in the apical meristem, the FT protein enters the nucleus and forms a complex with
FLOWERING D (FD), a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor that is expressed in the meristem. The complex of
FT and FD then activates floral meristem identity genes. Since the 1930s, there have been many unsuccessful attempts
to isolate and characterize. Thus, florigen remained a physiological concept rather than a chemical entity. However, the
FT protein exhibits all the properties that would be expected of florigen.

Using an analytical ultracentrifugation sedimentation velocity run, a researcher has calculated the S value
(Svedberg units) of a part of the freshly purified 12 kDa enzyme to be ~1.83, corresponding to its
monomeric state. However, during an identical run of the remaining protein after 2 days, the researcher
finds that the S value increased to ~2.57. What would be the correct conclusion about the enzyme in
question?
1. The enzyme is aggregated and forms a homo octamer.
2. The enzyme is monomeric but is now associated with the buffer components.
3. The enzyme has undergone monomer to a homodimer transition.
4. The enzyme has degraded due to autocatalytic activity.
Answer 3
The increase in the S value suggests that the protein has changed its sedimentation behavior, and the shift to a
higher S value often corresponds to an association or oligomerization state change. In this scenario, the change
from ~1.83 to ~2.57 suggests a transition from a monomeric state to a homodimeric state.

What is the typical maximum sustainable yield for a fish population, given that its carrying capacity (K)
is 20,000 and intrinsic growth rate (r) is 0.15?
1. 1,333
2. 1,500
3. 3,000
4. 6,666

Answer 2
The maximum sustainable yield for a fish population can be estimated using the logistic growth equation. The
logistic growth model takes into account the carrying capacity (K) and intrinsic growth rate (r) of a population.
The formula for maximum sustainable yield in a logistic growth model is often expressed as a fraction of the
carrying capacity (K). It is calculated as 0.5 × K × r.

Which one of the following statements about biological membranes is INCORRECT?
1. Lipid molecules can diffuse freely in the plane of the bilayer.
2. The ratio of the size of head group to fatty acyl chain of phospholipids contributes to the
curvature properties of lipid membranes.
3. Individual lipid molecules rapidly rotate along their :long axis.
4. Phospholipids freely diffuse from one leaflet of bilayer to another.
Answer 4
Phospholipids are made up of four components: an alcohol (glycerol or sphingosine), fatty acids, phosphate,
and an alcohol attached to the phosphate. The fatty acid components are hydrophobic, whereas the remainder
of the molecule has hydrophilic. Transverse diffusion to occur, the lipid head group, which is polar and may be
charged, must move into the hydrophobic interior of the bilayer. Hence, this process is not passive and requires
energy. The thermodynamic barrier prevents rapid spontaneous transverse diffusion of phospholipids and is,
therefore, a rare process.

The following statements were made about RNA editing:
A.

RNA editing can add or remove U's from the target mRNA.

B.

Editing occurs in the 5' - 3' direction by successive action of one or more guide RNAs.

C.

A terminal uridylyl transferase (TUTase) facilitates addition of extra UMPs (uridylates) to the mRNA during editing.

D.

The proteins required for editing are encoded by the mitochondrial DNA, while the required guide RNAs are encoded in
the nucleus and imported into the mitochondria.

Which one of the following options shows the combination of all correct statements?

1. A and B

2. A and C

3. B and C

4. B and D

Answer 2
Editing is thought to occur in four stages: gRNA/mRNA duplex formation, cleavage of the mRNA at target site, the addition or deletion of
U containing nucleotides (mostly) in the mRNA and finally the re-ligation of the two fragments of the newly edited mRNA. Depending on
the information present in the template region of the gRNA, uridylates may either be added to the pre-mRNA by a terminal uridyl
transferase or uridylates may be deleted by an uridyl exonuclease. Following U containing nucleotides insertion or deletion the 5’ and 3’
fragments of the pre-mRNA are ligated through the action of the editosome RNA ligases.

mitotic progression.
A. Cdc20

B. APC/C

the onset of anaphase during mitosis?
1. C only

2. A only

3. A, B, and C

4. B, C, and D

Answer 3
After the proper association of all chromosomes with spindle microtubules has occurred, the M-CDK complexes activate the
APC/C. Thus, M-CDK not only triggers the early mitotic events leading up to metaphase, but it also sets the stage for
progression into anaphase. APC/C acts on different substrates at different times. APC/C functions in coordination with two
homologous mitotic coactivators, Cdc20 and Cdh1 (Cdc20 homologue 1). APC/C initiates the metaphase-anaphase transition
through mediating the ubiquitination and degradation of M-cyclin and securin. Securin holds enzyme separase, a ubiquitous
cysteine protease, in an inactive state. The destruction of securing allows separase to cleave Scc1, a subunit of the cohesin
which holds the sister chromatids together.

Rotenone, a plant product, inhibits the transfer of electrons through complex I. It is used as a fish poison and as an insecticide.
Cyanide and azide bind with complex IV and inhibit the terminal transfer of electrons to oxygen. An antibiotic oligomycin
completely blocks ATP synthesis by blocking the flow of protons through F0 of ATP synthase (subscript ‘O’ denotes its
inhibition by antibiotic oligomycin).

This is a hypothetical example. Sequencing of the genome of an organism led to the identification of several ORFs. One of them was
found to code for a protein that showed sequence similarity to proteins known to have a role in early development. The protein was
named as Brainy. The results of RNA in situ hybridization in egg and 4-celled embryo is schematically depicted below:

Further, based on fate map, it was proposed that the B4 blastomere gave rise to the notochord. Different experiments were carried out
which led to the hypothesis that notochord developed autonomously by acquiring and retaining Brainy.
The following statements represent experiments that could support the above hypothesis and is also correctly matched with the outcome:
A.

Microinjection of brainy mRNA in other blastomeres would lead to ectopic development of notochord.

B.

If the 4 blastomeres were dissociated and allowed to develop individually, the B4 blastomere would cease to develop.

C.

Treating the 4-celled embryo with lithium chloride would lead to the ventralization of the embryo.

D.

Microinjection of morpholinos against brainy mRNA in B3 would convert the fate of B3 to that of B4.

does not become incorporated into microtubules, but does appear to function in the nucleation of microtubule formation.
γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC), a protein complex containing γ-tubulin and several accessory proteins, nucleates
microtubule polymerization. γ-TuRC is not the sole microtubule nucleator. In Xenopus egg, XMAP215 acts as a microtubule
nucleator. In the case of yeast, the spindle pole bodies (or duplication plaques) serve as MTOCs.

the enzyme to convert isocitrate into the oncometabolite, _ _ _ _ _ , which
accumu lates in cancer cells. This oncometabolite works by inhibiting several
enzymes that require _ _ _ _ for their function .

The magnetic field generated from an electromagnet is used in the transcranial
magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the brain. The following statements suggest some
features of TMS:
A.

The magnetic field generated in TMS induces an electrical field in the
underlying brain area.
The electrical field in the brain area alters the membrane potential of the
neurons ln that locality causing them to depolarize synchronously, which in
turn, may change the probabil ity of the firing of neurons.
In cognitive neuroscience research , TMS may be used as a tool to iinduce a
'virtual lesion' in a selected region of the cerebral cortex.
TMS is safe and non-invasive but the neuronal activity of the stimulated area
is disrupted for a long period of time.

Urine volume is increased in osmotic diuresis which may be experimentally
produced by the intravenous administration of mannitol that is filtered in the
glomerulus but not reabsorbed in the renal tubule. The following statements suggest
some of the physiological mechanisms of osmotic diuresis.
A.

In the proximal tubule, water reabsorption falls due to presence of mannitol in
tubular fluid and concentration of Na+ is decreased in this fluid.
In the descending loop of Henle, reabsorption of water is increased as
medullary hypertonicity is decreased in osmotic diuresis.
In the thin ascending loop of Henle, reabsorption of Na+ is increased as the
concentration gradient for Na+ is decreased.
In the collecting duct, reabsorption of water is less because of decrease in
osmotic gradient along the medullary pyramid in osmotic diuresis.

The evolution of algal lineages is close ly linked to endosymbiotic events. Which of
the fol liowing statements best explains the origin and diversification of plastids in
different algal groups?
1.

Primary plastids originated from a eukaryotic host cell engulfing a red algal
ancestor, followed by secondary endosymbiosis leading to the diversification
of green and brown algal lineages.

2.

Primary plastids evolved through the engulfment of a cyanobacterium by a
eukaryotic host, while secondary and tertiary endosymbiosis invollving red
and green aligae gave rise to plastids in diverse algal lineages such as
diatoms and dinoflagellates.

3.

All algal lineages acquired plastids through multiple independent primary
endosymbiosis events, with cyanobacteria being engulfed by both red and
green algal ancestors.

4.

Secondary endosymbiosis was responsible for the origin of primary plastids
in green algae, while tertiary endosymbiosis involving diatoms led to the
evolution of plastids in red algae.

Sturtevant introduced the concept of recombination frequency-based genetic maps.
Since genetic distances between genes may be underest:imated due to the
occurrence of double crossovers, other mapping functiions were developed to

Given be:low are a few statements about vesicu~ar transport.
A.

Clathrin-mediated endocytosis requires the recruitment of adaptors to the
cytosolic face of the plasma membrane.
The :low-pH environment of early endosomes leads to the dissociation of
cargo from its receptor, aUowing for the recycling of receptors to the plasma
membrane.
The iate endosomes, which mature into the lysosomes, are directly involved
in the recycling of synaptlc vesicle pro eins in neurons.
The multivesicular body pathway involves the formation of intraluminal
ves:icles, which sort cargo for degrada ion in the lysosomes.

Normal yeast cells grow at 42°C. Five yeast hap:l oid strains. with independent alleiles
of YFG1 having impaired cell growt h at 42°C. were isolated and labeled as yfg1ts1
to yfg1ts5. A haploid (yfg1ts1) carrying a spontaneously generated mutation (sup1)
at an ·ndependent locu s was isolated. which can grow at 42°C. Using pairw,ise
crossing , sup 1 was introduced into strains carrying yfg1ts2 to yfg1ts5 alleles. All
these haploids grew at 42°C.
Based on this data. the foUowing statements were made to describe the Sup1-Yfg1
molecular/genetic interaction.

Sup1 codes for a protein which, when over-expressed, stabilized mutant
yfg1 ts proteins.
Sup1 codes for a protein that physically interacts with Yfg1 protein.
Sup1 protein upregulates an allternate pathway.

T3SS mostly secretes Avr effector proteins directly into plant apoplast.
The genes encoding consetved components of the T3SS of plant and animal
pathogenic bacteria are referred to as Hrp (hypersensitive response and

T cell precursors that exit the bone marrow undergo pos,itive and negative selection
in the thymus before emerging as mature T cellls. These processes are controlled
by cellular interactions of the thymocyte with stromal ceUs in the thymus. The
foUowing statements are made regarding the selection process:
A.
B.
C.
D.

The selection process involves negative selection of auto-reactive cells in
the cortex followed by their mjgration to the medulla.
The selection process elies on the transcription factor 'Aire '.
The selection process can lead to the generation of CD4 cells that
can interact with dendritic cells (DCs) as well as B ce!Is.
The selection process can 1ead to the generation of regulatory CD4 T ceUs.

Consider a predator that can forage on two prey types, where Prey1 is the more
profitable prey and Prey2 is the less profitable prey. While searching for Prey1, if it
encounters Prey2, the decision to capture Prey2 or ignore it and continue to search
for Prey1 is given by the predictions of the Optimal :Foraging Theory (OFT). The table

Question No. 1 / Question ID 703051
Consider alleles ‘A’ and ‘a’ in a population. The frequency of heterozygotes will be highest when:
1. Frequency of ‘A’ is more than frequency of ‘a’.
2. Frequency of ‘A’ is less than frequency of ‘a’.
3. Frequency of ‘A’ is equal to frequency of ‘a’.
4. Frequency of ‘A’ and ‘a’ affects the frequency of homozygotes not heterozygotes.

Answer 3
The frequency of heterozygotes (Aa) is highest when the frequency of the two alleles (A and a) are equal.

Question No. 2 / Question ID 703058
Invasive species, in general grow very well in a new area that they invade, and often outcompete native
species. An explanation for the better growth and propagation of invasive species in comparison to their
native counterparts is provided by which one of the following hypotheses?
1. Ecological niche hypothesis
2. Intermediate disturbance hypothesis
3. Energy release hypothesis
4. Biotic resistance hypothesis

Answer 3
The enemy release hypothesis states that invasive species often do well in new environments because they are released
from the predation, parasitism, and competition that they faced in their native environments. In their new
environments, they may have no natural enemies or competitors, which allows them to grow and reproduce rapidly.

Recessive lethal alleles are never completely eliminated from the population because:
1. lethal alleles are always conditional in nature.
2. lethal alleles have selective advantage.
3. lethal alleles protect organisms from other deleterious mutations.
4. they are maintained in the population as heterozygotes.

Answer 4
Heterozygotes are individuals who have two different alleles for a gene, one dominant and one recessive. In the
case of a recessive lethal allele, the dominant allele will mask the recessive allele and the individual will be
unaffected.

In mature erythrocytes, the end-product of glycolysis that contains the carbons of glucose is:
1. ethanol
2. pyruvate
3. acetaldehyde
4. lactate

Answer 4
Mature erythrocytes are devoid of mitochondria and therefore cannot undergo cellular respiration. Instead,
they rely on glycolysis to generate energy. The end product of glycolysis in mature erythrocytes is lactate, which
is then released into the bloodstream.

Question No. 16 / Question ID 703063
Given that Asian Koel is a brood parasite, which one of the following statements is TRUE for this species?
1. The brood of the bird is usually infested with parasitic wasps.
2. The young ones learn the calls of their foster parents.
3. The bird feeds parasitic wasps to its brood.
4. The call of the species is innate and not learned.

Answer 4
Brood parasites, such as the Asian Koel, do not raise their own young. Instead, they lay their eggs in the nests of
other birds, who then raise the young as their own. This means that the young Asian Koel birds do not learn their
calls from their parents. Instead, their calls are innate, or programmed into their genes.

Question No. 17 / Question ID 703026
Which one of the following changes is energetically favorable and occurs spontaneously in an aqueous
solution?
1. Formation of a bilayer from phospholipid molecules
2. Dispersion of one oil droplet into many small ones
3. Tearing of the lipid bilayer
4. Conversion of a membrane vesicle to a flat bilayer

Answer 1
Dispersion of one oil droplet into many small ones is not energetically favorable because it would increase the surface
area of the oil droplets, which would increase the free energy of the system.

Question No. 18 / Question ID 703061
Which one of the following statements is correct for a primary successional species?
1. These species do not follow specific survivorship curves.
2. These species show Type II survivorship curve.
3. These species show Type III survivorship curve.
4. These species show Type I survivorship curve.

Answer 3
Primary successional species are the first species to colonize an area that is devoid of life, such as a newly formed lava
field or a newly exposed rock face. These species are typically small, hardy, and quick-growing, and they are able to
survive in harsh conditions. They are also able to reproduce quickly, which helps to ensure that their populations will
not be wiped out by natural disasters or other disturbances.

Question No. 19 / Question ID 703064
The following terms represent different methods in phylogenetic tree constructions.
A. Unweighted Pair Group Method sing Arithmetic Average (UPGMA)
B. Minimum Evolution (ME) method
C. Maximum Parsimony (MP) method
D. Maximum Likelihood (ML) method
Select the option that represents all distance-based methods?
1. A and B
2. B and C
3. C and D
4. A and D

Answer 3
UPGMA and ME are both distance-based methods. Distance-based methods construct phylogenetic trees by
calculating the distance between pairs of taxa and then using this information to infer the evolutionary relationships
between the taxa. UPGMA is a simple and computationally efficient method, but it can be inaccurate for large
datasets. ME is a more accurate method, but it is more computationally expensive.

Directional Selection for a particular trait will lead to the frequency of the trait:
1. being normally distributed in the population.
2. always showing a left-skewed distribution in the population.
3. always showing a right-skewed distribution in the population.
4. showing either a right- or a left-skewed distribution in the population.

Answer 4
The direction of the change in frequency will depend on the direction of the selection pressure. If the selection
pressure is for a trait that is more common in the population, the frequency of the trait will increase. If the selection
pressure is for a trait that is less common in the population, the frequency of the trait will decrease.
The distribution of the trait in the population may be either right-skewed or left-skewed, depending on the direction
of the selection pressure. A right-skewed distribution means that the trait is more common in the population than it
would be if there was no selection pressure. A left-skewed distribution means that the trait is less common in the
population than it would be if there was no selection pressure.

Which one of the following options represents the combination of all correct statements?
1. A and D

2.

B and D

3. A and C

4.

C and D

Answer 3

The key regulatory proteins are LexA repressor and RecA protein. The LexA acts as a transcriptional repressor for SOS responsive
genes (over 50 genes) that participate in processes such as DNA repair, homologous recombination and translesion DNA replication.
During normal growth, LexA proteins bind with specific operator sequences (called SOS box) located in the promoter region and
repress transcription. In E. coli, any block to DNA replication caused by DNA damage produces a signal that activates the E. coli RecA
protein. Activation of RecA causes autocatalytic proteolytic cleavage of the LexA repressor. Cleavage occurs at a specific Ala-Gly
peptide bond. RecA protein has two quite different types of activity. It acts as a co-protease and stimulates protease activity.

From the data in the figure above, the following conclusions were drawn:
A.

Full activation of ERK.5 requires both MEKK2 and MEK5.

B.

Phosphorylation with MEKK2 alone suggests that it can activate
ERK.5 without MEK5.

C.

Difference in the levels of phosphorylation with MEKK2 alone and

D.

Phosphorylation with only MEKK2 transfection suggests that it
might be associating with endogenous MEK5 to get partially
activated, leading to ERK5 phosphorylation to some extent.

It has been observed that within a flowering season a plant may produce more male flowers which may be
correlated with the longevity of the flowers and the seasonal distribution of flowering in the plant. Which one of
the following arguments do NOT support this observation of sex-specific floral phenology.
1.

Females are often resource limited and therefore pollination levels will be increased by producing more
male flowers.

2.

Fluctuations in the rainfall pattern can influence pollinator service due to altered physiology of the plant

Which one of the following options represents all correct statement(s)?
1. A only

2.

C only

3. B and C

4.

C and D

Answer 1

In blastema-mediated regeneration, differentiated cells undergo dedifferentiation to form undifferentiated cells. These cells then
start proliferating to form a mass of heterogeneous undifferentiated cells at the regenerating tip called blastema. Once a necessary
number of cells are amassed, the cells in blastema start to redifferentiate and initiate the process of morphogenesis similar to that
seen during embryogenesis. This process then culminates with the restoration of the lost tissue, either completely or partially
depending upon the organism.
In compensatory regeneration, the regeneration proceeds without any blastema formation or requirement of stem cells. In this
process, differentiated cells from the vicinity are recruited to the site of injury and proliferate to replace the lost tissue. Liver
regeneration is a prime example of compensatory regeneration.

Answer 4
B. Ferredoxin is reduced only in the oxidative carbon cycle. The oxidative carbon cycle involves the reduction of ferredoxin as part of the
photorespiration pathway. This reduction process helps in the conversion of 2-phosphoglycolate (a byproduct of Rubisco's oxygenase
activity) into useful compounds.
C. The product of the oxidative carbon cycle is one of the substrates of the reductive carbon cycle. The oxidative carbon cycle produces
glycine, which is then converted into serine. Serine, in turn, serves as a substrate for the reductive carbon cycle, as it can be converted
into 3-phosphoglycerate, an intermediate in sugar synthesis.

Answer 3

The specific activity of an enzyme is defined as the amount of enzyme activity (measured in enzyme units) per unit of protein. It is a
measure of the enzyme's catalytic efficiency and is often used to assess the purity of an enzyme preparation. Specific activity is
calculated by dividing the total enzyme activity by the amount of protein present in the sample. It provides a measure of the
concentration of active enzyme molecules in relation to the total protein content.

In temperate and subpolar regions, productivity is highest during the spring due to the transition of phytoplankton from lightlimited to nutrient-limited conditions. This is because during the winter, there is less sunlight available for photosynthesis, so
phytoplankton are limited by light. In the spring, as the days get longer and the sunlight becomes more intense, phytoplankton are
no longer limited by light and can begin to grow rapidly. This is when productivity is highest in these regions.

Question No. 62 / Question ID 703075

Answer 4
The conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, catalyzed by highly organized multienzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase
complex, is an oxidative decarboxylation process. In the overall reaction, the carboxyl group of pyruvate is lost as
CO2, while the remaining two carbons form the acetyl moiety of acetyl-CoA. The reaction is highly exergonic and
essentially irreversible in vivo. E1 first catalyzes the decarboxylation of pyruvate, producing hydroxyethyl-TPP, and
then the oxidation of the hydroxyethyl group to an acetyl group. The electrons from this oxidation reduce the disulfide
of lipoate bound to E2, and the acetyl group is transferred into thioester linkage with on –SH group of reduced
lipoate. E2 catalyzes the transfer of the acetyl group to coenzyme A, forming acetyl-CoA. E3 (Dihydrolipoyl
dehydrogenase) catalyzes the regeneration of the disulfide (oxidized) form of lipoate; electrons pass first to FAD and
then to NAD+.

Which one of the following options represents the combination of all correct statements?
1. A and C
2. B and D
3. A only
4. B only

Pathfinder Academy

Answer 2
Micrococcal nuclease (Mnase), derived from
Staphylococcus aureus, is an endoexonuclease that exhibits relatively nonspecific activity towards both RNA and DNA
substrates. The centromeric region of the
chromosome, known as the heterochromatin
region, is highly condensed. As a result, it is
less susceptible to digestion by Mnase.
Consequently, when subjected to Mnase
treatment in separate tubes for 1 hour, 3
hours, 6 hours, and 12 hours, the level of
digestion is not significantly high in this
region. On the other hand, the euchromatin
region of the chromosome, which is less
condensed, is more sensitive to Mnase.
Therefore, the degree of digestion with
Mnase in separate tubes for 1 hour, 3 hours, 6
hours, and 12 hours progressively increases
over time in this region.

A bacterial culture initiated from a single bacterial cell with a DNA repair- deficient system is inoculated into several individual
test tubes and allowed to grow in parallel. Wild type cells are also inoculated in a similar manner and grown simultaneously.
After several generations, individual cultures are tested for resistance to antibiotics. Which one of the following statements
describes the most likely outcome?
a.

More antibiotic resistant cells will emerge from the DNA repair-deficient cultures and all wild type cells will be sensitive.

b.

Wild type cells will produce more antibiotic resistant populations than the DNA repair-deficient cells.

c.

The DNA repair-deficient cells may produce more antibiotic resistant cells but wild type cells will also produce some
antibiotic resistant population.

d.

The DNA repair-deficient cells would be dead and therefore will not produce any resistant population of cells.

Answer c

DNA repair-deficient cells are more likely to develop antibiotic resistance because they are more susceptible to DNA damage. When
DNA is damaged, it can lead to mutations, which can then lead to antibiotic resistance. Wild type cells, on the other hand, have a more
robust DNA repair system, which makes them less susceptible to DNA damage and therefore less likely to develop antibiotic resistance.

A colour blind father has a daughter who is also colour blind and has Turner’s syndrome. The genotype
of the daughter is due to:
a. Translocation event in the father.
b. Translocation event in the mother.
c. Non-disjunction event in the mother.
d. Non-disjunction event in the father.

Answer c
In this scenario, the father is color blind, which suggests that he carries a mutation in the genes responsible for color vision.
The daughter, being color blind like her father, would have inherited this mutation from him. The additional condition of
Turner syndrome (45, X) in the daughter is not directly related to the father's color blindness. This condition occurs due to a
non-disjunction event during meiosis in the mother, where the X chromosomes fail to separate properly.

Which one of the following statements is correct?
a. None of the virulence genes of Agrobacterium tumefaciens are expressed constitutively.
b. Integration of T-DNA with the nuclear genome of plant cells occurs only by homologous recombination.
c. Host plant genes do not play any role in Agrobacterium-mediated transfer of T-DNA into plant cells.
d. Opines are a source of nitrogen for Agrobacterium cells.

Answer d
virA and virG genes are expressed constitutively.
In the plant cell nucleus, the single-stranded T-strand is converted into double-stranded T-DNA and integrated
into the plant genome. Integration into the plant genome occurs at an apparently random position through nonhomologous
recombination.
Opines are of different types: nopaline, octopine and agropine. These opines are condensation products of either an amino
acid and a keto acid or an amino acid and a sugar. The opines are used as a carbon and nitrogen source and are catabolized by
Agrobacterium.

A tree species has leaves that contain an allelochemical compound that leaches into the soil and prevents
the growth of its own seedlings. What kind of dispersion pattern is likely as a result of this process in the
adult population of this species?
a. Random

b.

Clumped

c. Uniform

d.

Bimodal

Answer c

Uniform dispersion is characterized often by organisms that are territorial in nature and wind up equally spaced apart
due to the defense of their immediate surroundings. A uniform distribution tends to line up in even rows similar to
trees planted in neat and even rows. An example of a plant that does this in nature is the sage plant (Salvia leucophylla).
This sage plant releases a toxin that kills plants in the nearby vicinity. Since the area immediately surrounding the sage
is made inhabitable by the toxin, sage plants wind up aligning with a distinctly empty radius surrounding them.

When a dihybrid cross produces progeny in two
phenotypic classes in a 15:1 ratio, this can be because the
two loci’s gene products have the same (redundant)
functions within the same biological pathway.

Which one of the following parameters of a healthy leaf plays the major role in its reflectance in the near
infrared region?
a. Water content in the leaf
b. Concentration of chlorophyll in the leaf
c. Concentration of carotenes and xanthophylls in the leaf
d. Arrangement of spongy and palisade mesophyll tissue of the leaf

Answer d*
The near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum is strongly absorbed by water, so the reflectance of a leaf in
this region is inversely proportional to its water content. This means that leaves with high water content will have low
reflectance in the near-infrared region, while leaves with low water content will have high reflectance.

Which one of the following mechanisms permits immunoglobulin to be synthesized in either a membranebound or secreted form?
a. Allelic exclusion
b. Class switch recombination
c. Differential RNA processing
d. Codominant expression
Answer c
Cells switch from the synthesis of the membranebound to secreted forms of IgM and IgD by
alternative RNA splicing. Whether secreted or
membrane-bound antibody is made depends on
which poly(A) site is selected during processing of
the primary transcript. The ability to switch
between the membrane-bound and the secreted
form of immunoglobulin heavy chains is
controlled by alternative use of polyadenylation
sites (not by alternative splicing).

In a hydrogen bond of the type D-H...A, where D-H is a weakly acidic donor group and A is a lone-pairbearing acceptor atom, the D... A distance is
a. one-and-a-half times the sum of the van Der Waals radii.
b. equal to the sum of the van Der Waals radii.
c. less than the sum of the van Der Waals radii.
d. twice the sum of die van Der Waals radii.

Answer c
The D...A distance in a hydrogen bond is typically less than the sum of the van der Waals radii of the D-H and A
atoms. This is because the hydrogen bond creates a partial negative charge on the acceptor atom and a partial
positive charge on the hydrogen atom. The partial charges on the atoms repel each other, which increases the
distance between the atoms.

Mutation rates can vary significantly among different organisms, as well as within different regions of the genome within a single
organism. Several factors influence mutation rates, including the type of organism, the specific DNA sequence or genomic region being
considered, environmental factors, and evolutionary pressures.
A suppressor mutation is a second mutation that restores a function lost by the first mutation. Mutations of this kind are called
suppressor mutations because they suppress the effects of the first mutations. True back mutation restores the original wild-type
nucleotide sequence of the gene, whereas a suppressor mutation does not. Suppressor mutations may occur at distinct sites in the
same gene as the first mutation or in different genes, even on different chromosomes.

Given below are some statements that are associated with transgenic plants. Each statement has a blank space indicated by
‘______’
A. A transgenic plant with two functional copies of a transgene can segregate in a ______ ratio for the transgenic phenotype on
self-pollination if the two genes are linked.
B. The _____ system can be used for removal of marker genes from transgenic plants.
C. The endogenous plant gene, _____,‘ can be used to engineer resistance to imidazolinone herbicides.
D. Variations in transgene expression levels between five independent transgenic lines generated using the same T-DNA
construct can be due to ______.
Which one of the following options has the correct sequence of terms that can be used to fill in the blanks in the above
statements from (A to D) such that all statements become true?
a. A-9:3:3:1;

B-Cre/loxP;

C-ALS;

D-codon usage of the transgene

b. A-3:1;

B-FLP/FRT;

C-bar;

D-copy number of transgene

c. A-3:1;

B-Cre/loxP;

C-ALS;

D-position effect

d. A-1:2:1;

B-FLP/FRT;

C-EPSPS;

D-position effect

Answer c
Cre is a 38 kDa tyrosine recombinase protein (belongs to ‘integrase’ family) from bacteriophage P1 which mediates site specific recombination
between loxP sites. A loxP site (34 bp long) consists of two 13 bp inverted repeats separated by an 8 bp spacer or core region where recombination
takes place.
The FLP-FRT system is similar to the Cre-loxP system. It involves FLP recombinase, derived from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. FLP recognizes
FLP recombinase target (FRT) sequences. FRT is a 34 bp-long sequence. The site contains two inverted repeats of 13 bp each, separated by a central
and asymmetric sequence of 8 bp, or spacer, which defines the orientation of the site.

A letter from Bruce Alberts
(author of Molecular Biology of the Cell)

Some feedback on your two Life Sciences volumes – for authors only
Bruce Alberts
Dear Usha and Pranav,
I have ﬁnally ﬁnished reading through many sections of your large two-volume introductory
biology textbook, and I write to provide some feedback that might possibly help with your next
edition.
Let me start by saying how impressed I am that such a wide-ranging textbook was written by
only two authors. For those sections where I am most knowledgeable – which I read closely -- I
ﬁnd it to be remarkably accurate. As you well know, most such textbooks that attempt to cover all
of biology are written by a sizeable team of authors – each with a diﬀerent expertise -- who in
addition acknowledge help from a large number of other experts. And it is great to learn that you
are able to provide these two volumes at a low price that Indian students can aﬀord.
My ﬁrst question concerns the way that this material has been divided up into two separate
volumes. If I were a student, I would have felt a need to learn about genetic mechanisms (which
you call “genetics”) in volume 1, before learning about how proteins are sorted through internal
membranes, for example.
A major concern that I would have is one of level. I ﬁnd that in many places you go into
considerably more detail that we do in MBOC (molecular biology of the cell), even though the
latter book is aimed at a more advanced student population than I believe yours is. Biology is
such a huge subject that we can easily lose students in all the details, when what is most
important for them learn are the concepts. Students often feel a need to memorize such details:
in our interviews with sets of students who had just used our textbook, we found that many
(most?) lack the judgement to ignore them when preparing for exams. For the same reason, we
also leave out many of the scientiﬁc words in our book, like 2.27 helix, linking number, abzyme,
etc.
I hope that you ﬁnd these comments useful, and I write to wish you the very best in 2023, as well
as to encourage you in all of your future eﬀorts!
With my best wishes,
Bruce

In Caenorhabditis elegans, blastomere identity occurs both through conditional
and autonomous modes of cell specification. Which one of the followi ng options
is a correct statement in this regard?
1.

If the AB and P1 blastomeres are experimentally separated , the AB cell wil l
generate all cells it would normally make.
When AB divides to form daughter cells , ABp becomes different from ABa
through its interaction with the P2 cell.
The specification of AB cell is determ ined by the presence of cytoplasm ic
determinants.
The P2 cell produces a morphogen for the determination of the ABp cell.

Genetic markers would always show higher recombination frequencies
when they are closer to each other than if they are far apart.
The genetic distance between two markers is a true representation of the
physical distance between them.
An ideal mapping population for a self-pollinating species is generated
using polymorphic parents that are inbred lines.
An F2 mapping population would segregate in a 1:2:1 ratio for a dominant
marker.

D.

Transgenic plants generated using a transformation vector with the
CaMV35S promoter-GUS-35SpA cassette can show variations in
expression levels of GUS protein in independent transgenic events due to
differences in strength of promoter used to express the GUS gene.
A transgen ic plant conta ining two insertions of the transgene cassette as
inverted repeats in tandem would segregate in a 3: 1 ratio for the transgenic
phenotype on backcrossing the transgenic plant with the untransformed
parent.
A transgene containing a potential polyadenylation signal in its coding
sequence would generate full-length transgene mRNA but a truncated
transgenic protein .
A gene-pyramiding experiment to bring together two transgenic traits by

SLN1 receptor, a part of a two-component system , is required for osmoregulatlon
in yeast. The yeast mutant (sln1) lacking the SLN 1 receptor protein dies. A
researcher tries to rescue the mutant by expressing an Arabidopsis gene for the
cytokinin receptor, CRE1 , which like SLN1 is also a histidine kinase that acts
through a two-component system.
The following statements are made regarding the outcome of the experiment.
A.
B.
C.
D.

SLN1 and CRE1 proteins respond to the same external signals and
therefore, CRE1 rescues the yeast mutant.
As CRE1 cannot interact with the downstream signaling pathway in the
yeast, it will not rescue the yeast mutant.
CRE1 will rescue the yeast mutant, only if cytokinin is present.
The effector domains of CRE 1 and SLN1 proteins are sufficiently simi lar
and therefore , CRE1 can induce the downstream signal ing pathway and
rescue the yeast mutant.

Which one of the fol lowing options represents the combination of all correct
statements?

The following statements have been made regardi ng cell specification in an early
embryo:
A.

The entire embryo rarely interacts with its environment, and its
developmental trajectory cannot be guided by its immed iate "ecosystem ".

B.

When cells are removed , changes in ce llular biochem istry and function
are never preceded by a process involving the comm itment of the cell to a
certain fate.

C.

The fate of a cell or a tissue in the intact embryo is sa id to be specified
wh en it is not capable of diffe rentiating autonomously on bei ng placed in a
neutral environment, such as a petri dish or test tube.

D.

If cells are removed , the interactions of the remaining cells compensate
the fate of the removed cells, beca use the fate of a cell depends upon the
cond itions in w hich the cell finds itself.

W ith regard to the experiment show n be low, w here removal of ce lls from an early
blastula leads to normal development of the larval fo rm, w hich one of the above

Overexpression of protei n 'A' in the brai n of Drosophila melanogaster causes the
degradation of ovaries in the animal. Overexpression of a secretion-i ncompetent
allele of 'A' does not cause this phenotype. However, downregulation of protein
'B' in ovarl es co ncom itant with overexpression of protei n 'A in the brain prevents
ovary degradation . 'A' and 'B' are fou nd to physically interact in ovary lysates . In
the li ght of the above experiments, which of the fo ll ow ing inferences would be
correct?
The protei n 'A' ce ll autonomously influences ovary development whi le B is
secreted to influence brain fu nction.
'A' is a ligand secreted from the brain and 'B' is a receptor in ovaries.
'A' is a neurotransmitter secreted from the brai n and 'B' is a signal
transducer in the ova ries .
'A' is a receptor secreted from the ovaries and 'B' is a ligand in the ovary
cell membrane.

Question No. 25 / Question ID 703598

Marks: 4.00

In a hypothetical organism , at a four-celled embryonic stage, blastomere 'X'
instructs one of the daughter cells of an adjoining blastomere 'Y' to take the fate
'Ya'. The other daughter cell takes the fate 'Yp'. This is illustrated in the figure
below as lineages for Ya and Yp. If the X blastomere is removed , both daughter
cells take up the Yp fate.
Normal development

In the absence of

blastomere X

This instruction is mediated by a paracrine factor, Pap2 secreted by X blastomere
interacting with Pap5 present on the membrane of Y blastomere.
The following experimental manipulations were carried out, which involved
creating partial genetically mosaic embryos in vitro and following the fate of the
Y blastomere.
Which one of the mosaics will show a developmental pattern similar to that when
blastomere X is removed?
1.
2.
3.
4.

X blastomere null for Pap2 and wild type Y blastomere
Wild type X blastomere and constitutively activated Pap5 Y blastomere
X blastomere null for Pap2 and constitutively activated Pap5 Y blastomere

A complete retroposon was cloned under the entire galactose inducible
promoter. The construct, as shown below, was inserted in the yeast genome to
study the transposition event.

Novel Element

Some of the predicted outcomes are listed below:
A.
B.
C.
D.

Cells grown in presence of glucose or galactose lead to increase in copy
number of the transposon.
The transposed copies will be same as the construct inserted in the
genome.
The transposed copies cannot transpose further.
The transposed copies will not respond to either glucose or galactose in
the media.

Assuming that the hypothesis is correct, choose the option that has all likely
outcomes.

The ratio of total protein content to total RNA content was measured in yeast
cells in log phase during growth in minimal med ia and in minimal media
supplemented with amino acid cockta il. In the latter case , the ratio of protein to
RNA increased dramatically. Which one of the following is a correct inference
from the above information?
1.
2.
3.
4.

In minimal medium, proteins are degraded at a higher rate.
In amino acid-supplemented culture conditions, fewer ribosomes are
simu ltaneously active on a single transcript.
In minimal medium, amlno acid ava ilab ility limits protein translation to a
greater extent than transcription.
Am in o acid supplementation reduces RNA synth esis by modification of
RNA Pol II.

For a popu lation that grow s exponentially in the time interval (t, t+1 ), we have
Nt+1 = R Nt, wh ere N denotes population size and R denotes the growth rate.
Under intraspecific competition where births and deaths are density dependent,
we expect the pop ulation to stabilize at carrying capacity, K. In the figure below,
Nt INt+1 is plotted as a linear function of Nt.

The inhibitory IKBa protein binds to the NFKB dimer and holds them in an inactive
state. On TNF treatment, the IKBa protein is degraded and NFKB enters the
nucleus to transactivate gene expression. Importantly, one of the transcriptional
targets of NFKB is the IKBa gene itself. Together, they form a negative feedback
loop. Which one of the following graphs represents the NFKB protein expression
kinetics when TNF exposure is given as a pulse (a) or continuously (b)?

A letter from Bruce Alberts
(author of Molecular Biology of the Cell)

Some feedback on your two Life Sciences volumes – for authors only
Bruce Alberts
Dear Usha and Pranav,
I have ﬁnally ﬁnished reading through many sections of your large two-volume introductory
biology textbook, and I write to provide some feedback that might possibly help with your next
edition.
Let me start by saying how impressed I am that such a wide-ranging textbook was written by
only two authors. For those sections where I am most knowledgeable – which I read closely -- I
ﬁnd it to be remarkably accurate. As you well know, most such textbooks that attempt to cover all
of biology are written by a sizeable team of authors – each with a diﬀerent expertise -- who in
addition acknowledge help from a large number of other experts. And it is great to learn that you
are able to provide these two volumes at a low price that Indian students can aﬀord.
My ﬁrst question concerns the way that this material has been divided up into two separate
volumes. If I were a student, I would have felt a need to learn about genetic mechanisms (which
you call “genetics”) in volume 1, before learning about how proteins are sorted through internal
membranes, for example.
A major concern that I would have is one of level. I ﬁnd that in many places you go into
considerably more detail that we do in MBOC (molecular biology of the cell), even though the
latter book is aimed at a more advanced student population than I believe yours is. Biology is
such a huge subject that we can easily lose students in all the details, when what is most
important for them learn are the concepts. Students often feel a need to memorize such details:
in our interviews with sets of students who had just used our textbook, we found that many
(most?) lack the judgement to ignore them when preparing for exams. For the same reason, we
also leave out many of the scientiﬁc words in our book, like 2.27 helix, linking number, abzyme,
etc.
I hope that you ﬁnd these comments useful, and I write to wish you the very best in 2023, as well
as to encourage you in all of your future eﬀorts!
With my best wishes,
Bruce

Q.127 Given below are four niche-oriented models proposed to explain species-abundance
distri butions in ecolog ica l com munities.
A.

The dominance-preemption model involves successive species preempting a
dominant portion (50% or more) of the rema ining niche-space.

B.

In the random fraction model , successive species invade and take over an
arbitrary portion of the niche space of any species previously present. Here,
irrespective of their dominance status, all species are subjected to niche division
with equa l probability.

C.

The MacArthur fraction model assumes that larger niches are more likely to be
invaded by new species.

D.

The dominance-decay model postulates that the largest niche in an existing
assemblage is always subject to a subsequent (random ) division .

Which one of the following statements about the recognition of tRNAs by their cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases is
correct?
a.

Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases recognize their cognate tRNAs by the exclusive recognition of their anticodons.

b. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases recognize their cognate tRNAs by recognition of their anticodons in some tRNAs only.
c.

Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases cannot aminoacylate a tRNA that lacks the conserved modifications in the TϕC loop.

d. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases cannot aminoacylate a tRNA that lacks the conserved modifications in the DHU loop.

Answer b
Attachment of an amino acid to tRNA involves a covalent linkage between the carboxyl group of the amino acid and
the 2’ or 3’-hydroxyl group of the adenine containing nucleotide at the 3’ end of the tRNA. This process (called
aminoacylation) is catalyzed by an enzyme called aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (also known as aminoacyl-tRNA ligase).
In general, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases recognize the anticodon loops and acceptor arms of tRNA molecules.

In a conjugation experiment between bacterial Hfr strain ‘X’ and F– cell, lac gene enters the recipient in 4 minutes, but the F– cells
remain auxotrophic for Leu, Trp, Ura, Glu, Phe and Gly. The mating is then allowed to proceed for 20 minutes and lac+ excojugants
are selected. Of the lac+ cells,
35% are leu+
98% are trp+
10% are ura+
65% are glu+
0% are phe+
81% are gly+
Select the correct order of the genes as they enter, from the choices given below:
a.

trp+, gly+, glu+, leu+, ura+, phe+, lac+

b.

lac+, phe+, ura+, leu+, glu+, gly+, trp+

c.

phe+, ura+, leu+, glu+, gly+, trp+, lac+

d.

lac+, trp+, gly+, glu+, leu+, ura+, phe+

Answer d
Conjugation between different Hfr and F– strains can be used to map the relative positions of genes in the bacterial chromosome. The mapping
procedure is based on the fact that genes closer to the origin of transfer will be transferred at a higher frequency than genes farther away from
the origin of transfer.

The following picture represents a gel profile of a pair of DNA markers observed in parents P1 and P2, their F1 progeny and F2
progeny. Four different profiles were observed in case of F2. The number of F2 progeny showing a given profile is indicated in
brackets.
Based on the above observation, which one of the following statements is correct?
a.

Co-dominant DNA markers were used for this study.

b.

The polymorphic DNA bands represents two independent genes.

c.

If the P1 parent was crossed to the F1 individual, the progeny will show all the
four profiles as observed in the case of F2 progeny.

d.

If an F2 progeny which does not show either of the DNA markers (last lane of
the above gel) is crossed to a P1 individual, the obtained progeny will have two
types of individual, one which shows a band and the other where no band is
observed.

Answer b
The F2 progeny exhibiting a Mendelian phenotypic ratio of 9:3:3:1 suggests the independent assortment of two genes and complete
dominance in their allelic relationship. This means that each gene is inherited independently of the other, and the dominant allele will
always be expressed over the recessive allele.

Question ID: 51
The additive nature of a genetic map as suggested by Alfred Sturtevant and T. H. Morgan is possible if there is
a. no interference in crossovers.
b. complete interference in crossovers.
c. partial interference in crossovers.
d. variable interference in crossovers dependent on the genetic distances.

Answer b
Interference refers to the phenomenon where a crossover event in one region of a chromosome affects the likelihood of a crossover
occurring in nearby regions. If there is no interference in crossovers, it means that the occurrence of one crossover event does not affect the
likelihood of another crossover event happening nearby. If there is complete interference in crossovers, it means that the occurrence of one
crossover event prevents any additional crossovers from occurring in nearby regions. The additive nature of a genetic map is possible if there
is complete interference in crossovers.

The following are selected plant apomorphies:
A.

Development of xylem.

B.

Development of cuticle.

C.

Development of independent sporophyte.

D.

Development of eustele.

Which option represents the correct evolutionary sequence of the above?
a.

A-D-B-C

b.

C-A-B-D

c.

B-C-A-D

d.

C-B-D-A

Answer c
The development of cuticle is considered one of the earliest apomorphies in the plant kingdom, providing a protective waxy layer
on the surface of the plant to reduce water loss. The development of an independent sporophyte was next major evolutionary
development that allowed plants to colonize land. the development of xylem, responsible for transporting water and minerals, can
be considered as a subsequent apomorphy that evolved after the establishment of an independent sporophyte. The development
of a eustele was a later evolutionary innovation that allowed plants to grow taller.

The biological species concept defines species as a group of populations that are reproductively isolated from
others. However, this definition is not applicable to groups where sexual reproduction has not been observed yet or
is extremely rare. Choose the correct option of organisms where biological species concept may therefore not apply:
a. Monocots and basal angiosperms
b. Ascomycetes and oligochaetes
c. Mosses and liverworts
d. Cyanobacteria and Euglenophyta

Answer d
The biological species concept, defines species in terms of interbreeding. According to Ernst Mayr, species are groups of
interbreeding natural populations that are reproductively isolated from other such groups. Reproductively isolated means that
members of the species do not interbreed with members of other species. Biological species concept is not applicable in bacteria
due to the lack of sexual reproduction.

The measurement of distance based on counting steps or number of vertical bars by insects for navigation is called
a. path integration
b. allocentric coding
c. odometry
d. alignment image-matching

Answer c
Odometry refers to the process by which an organism estimates its position or distance traveled based on internal
sensory information. Insects, such as ants, bees, and desert ants, use odometry as a navigational strategy to keep track
of their movement. They count their steps or use other internal mechanisms to estimate the distance they have
traveled, allowing them to navigate back to their nest or a desired location.

Question ID: 63
Consider a predator species foraging for prey in a habitat, where there are two prey species A and B. Assume the foraging
predator can choose from a high-value prey A and low-value prey B. A and B occur at different frequencies in the environment,
so it may take different average times to find the next A or B individual. Choose the correct option based on the optimal
foraging theory.
a.

If it takes too long to search for A, predators may switch to eating B only.

b.

If it takes too long to search for A, predators may eat both A and B, whichever is encountered.

c.

Predators will only feed on B, regardless of search time.

d.

Predators will never feed on B, irrespective of its relative frequency.

Answer b
Animals search (forage), sense, detect and consume foods. For animals, foraging involves a balance between a food’s energy content
and the cost of obtaining it. Foraging behavior can directly influence energy intake and individual fitness. In above scenario, if it takes
too long to search for the high-value prey species A, predators would not exclusively focus on searching for A but would also consume
the low-value prey species B when encountered. This behavior allows them to maximize their energy intake by exploiting the available
resources efficiently.

Any movie that features dinosaurs should also have which of the following combinations of geological
age-appropriate organisms? Choose the correct combination.
a. Humans, angiosperms and gymnosperms, birds.
b. Early diverging angiosperms, reptiles, amphibians.
c. Apes, gymnosperms, birds.
d. Early diverging gymnosperms, amphibians, reptiles.

Answer d (However, answer given by NTA is b)
Dinosaurs existed during the Mesozoic Era, which is divided into three geological periods: the Triassic, Jurassic, and
Cretaceous. During this time, early angiosperms (flowering plants) had not yet diversified or become dominant.
They emerged later in the Mesozoic and experienced significant diversification during the Cretaceous period.
Reptiles and amphibians, on the other hand, were indeed present during the time of dinosaurs.

Question ID: 65
If you want to selectively kill the newly dividing mammalian cells in a cell culture assay, which of the following
methods will you use?
a. Exposure to UV radiation at 250 nm.
b. Treatment with 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU), followed by doxorubicin hydrochloride treatment.
c. Treatment with 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU), followed by UV-A exposure.
d. Tritiated thymidine treatment followed by vinblastine treatment.

Answer c
5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) is a thymidine analog that is incorporated into DNA during the S phase of
the cell cycle. When BrdU-labeled cells are exposed to UV-A light, the BrdU is converted to a photoreactive
compound that damages the DNA, leading to cell death. This method is selective for newly dividing cells
because only cells that are actively incorporating BrdU into their DNA will be killed.

Which one of the following traits would hypothetically not be considered for preferential selection during
domestication of the corresponding crops listed below?
a. Increased fruit size of tomato
b. Reduced spininess in okra
c. Shattering seeds of corn
d. Increased oil content of mustard

Answer c
Shattering seeds are seeds that disperse naturally when they are ripe. However, it is not a desirable trait in
domesticated plants, as it makes it difficult to collect the seeds. Therefore, farmers would not preferentially
select for shattering seeds in corn. Instead, they would select for seeds that do not shatter, so that they can
be easily collected and stored.

mitosis. This requires ubiquitination of a cyclin destruction box motif in cyclin B. RNase-treated Xenopus egg
extracts and sperm chromatin were mixed. MPF activity increased with chromosome condensation and nuclear
envelope breakdown. However, this was not followed by chromosome decondensation and nuclear envelope
reformation because
a. RNase contamination persisted in the system.

at the 5’-end and a quencher at 3’-end are used. While the probe is intact, the proximity of the quencher reduces
the fluorescence emitted by reporter dye. If the target sequences (wild type or the variant) are present, the probe
anneals to the target sequence, downstream to one of the primers used for amplifying the DNA sequence flanking
the position of the variants. For an assay two flanking PCR primers, two probes corresponding to the wild type and
variant allele and labelled with two different reporter dyes and quencher were used. During extension the probe may
be cleaved by the Taq-polymerase separating the reporter dye and the quencher. Three individuals were genotyped

2A = B + C; given that B = 67°
2A = 67° + C

…(1)

As we know that, in triangle A + B + C = 180°
A + 67° + C = 180°
A = 180° – (67° + C)
From equation (1), 2 × [180° – (67° + C)] = 67° + C
360° – 134° – 2C = 67° + C
3C = 360° – 134° – 67° = 360° – 201° = 159°
So, C = 159°/3 = 53°

mv2; where, m is the mass and v is the velocity or speed.

Here the speed remains same in two cases. So, energy expenditure (E) is proportional to mass or weight of the body.
Thus, E1 : E2 = W1 : W2 = 1 : 0.8; because overweight person losing 20% of his body weight.
So, energy expenditure (E2) in the second case would also be 20% less.

037. A major practical distinction between the eukaryotic RNA Pol is drawn from their response to the bicyclic octapeptide
-amanitin. In all eukaryotic cells the activity of RNA polymerase II is rapidly inhibited by low concentrations of
-amanitin. RNA polymerase I is not inhibited. The response of RNA polymerase III to -amanitin is less well
conserved; in animal cells it is inhibited by high levels, but in yeast and insects it is not inhibited.

044. Correct option should be P and R.
045. Homing introns encode an endonuclease that is responsible for their movement. The endonuclease cleaves a
recognition sequence within the target gene and generates short overhanging ends. This double-stranded break
triggers a gene conversion event in which the intact version of the gene is copied and used to repair the break.
Group II homing introns are retro-elements that use an RNA intermediate. The proteins they encode have both
endonuclease and reverse transcriptase activity.

047. Initiation Factor 1 (IF1) is required for the initiation of translation in Escherichia coli. However, the precise function
of IF1 remains unknown. Current evidence suggests that IF1 is an RNA-binding protein that sits in the A-site of
the decoding region of 16S rRNA. IF1 binding to 30S sub-units changes the reactivity of nucleotides in the A site
to chemical probes.
IF3 is an RNA-binding protein. It is known to function as:
1. IF3 antagonizes the association between 30S and 50S subunits;
2. IF3 accelerates the on-rate of codon–anticodon interaction at the P-site, thus stimulating the formation of
30S initiation complexes.

074. In the current view, ethylene is sensed by a family of receptors that show similarity to the bacterial two-component
histidine kinases, and function as negative regulators of the pathway. Binding of the ethylene gas turns off the
receptors, resulting in the inactivation of another negative regulator of ethylene signaling, CTR1, a Raf-like protein
kinase that directly interacts with the receptors. EIN2, a protein of unknown biochemical activity that functions as
a positive regulator of the pathway, acts downstream of CTR. Activation of EIN2 by ethylene leads to the activation
of EIN3 and EIN3-like transcription factors. In the absence of ethylene, the levels of EIN3 protein are extremely
low because of the function of two F-box-containing proteins, EBF1 and EBF2, that target EIN3 for proteasomemediated degradation. In the presence of ethylene, the EIN3 protein accumulates in the nucleus and initiates a
transcriptional cascade, resulting in the activation and repression of hundreds of genes.

Wild-type 5’ TAC CGT GGA CTT GA 3’
Mutant

5’ TAC CGT GAC TTG AG 3’

If we align these sequence we find that a single change caused frameshift (insertion or deletion) which resulted in
change of sequence after TACCGTG (shown in bold). If it would have been missense mutation rest of the sequence
after one base should not change. In case of nonsense mutation stop codon should be introduced.
145. Wavelength, aperture N are related through Abbe’s equation as,
D=

N sin a

D should be as small as possible for better resolution. In order to make D small,  should be small, N and  should
be large. Therefore, decrease in the value of  or increase either N or  will improve resolution (statement P)
and using a medium with high refraction index (N) between the specimen and the objective lens to improve the
resolution (statement R).

79. Lipid rafts are rich in both sphingolipids and
cholesterol. Cholesterol plays a central
role in raft formation since lipid rafts
apparently do not form in its absence. Why do
you think cholesterol is essential for the
formation of lipid rafts?
1. Cholesterol decreases the mobility of
sphingolipids in the lipid bilayer.
2. Large head groups of sphingolipids repel
each other in presence of cholesterol.
3. Cholesterol interacts with fatty acid tails
in the membrane.
4. The planar cholesterol molecules are
postulated to fill the voids that form
underneath the large head groups of the
sphingolipids.

81. You have labelled DNA in a bacterium by
growing cells in medium containing either
14
N nitrogen or the heavier isotope, 15N.
Furthermore, you have isolated pure DNA
from these organisms, and subjected it to
CsCl density gradient centrifugation leading
to their separation of light (14N) and heavy
(15N) forms of DNA to different locations
in the centrifuge tube. In the next experiment,
bacteria were grown first in medium
containing 15N, so that all the DNA made by
cells will be in heavy form. Then these
cells were transferred to medium containing
only 14N and allowed the cells to divide for
one generation. DNAs were extracted and
centrifuged as above in the CsCl gradient. A
hybrid DNA band was observed at a position
located between and equidistant from the
15
N and 14N DNA bands. Based on the above
observation, which one of the following
conclusions is correct?
1. Replication of DNA is conservative
2. Replication of DNA is semi-conservative
3. Replication of DNA is dispersive
4. Replication by rolling circle mode

83. Although
ribonucleoside
triphosphates
(rNTPs) are present at approximately 10-fold
higher concentration than deoxyribo-न
nucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) in the cell,
but they are incorporated into DNA at a rate
that is more than 1000-fold lower than
dNTPs. This is because
1. DNA polymerase cannot discriminate
between dNTPs and rNTPs. But as soon
as rNTPs are incorporated in the DNA
chain, they are hydrolyzed due to the
presence of 2-OH group.
2. DNA polymerase cannot discriminate
between dNTPs and rNTPs. But as soon
https://pathfinderacademy.in/

https://pathfinderacademy.in/

22
as rNTPs are incorporated in the DNA
chain, they are excised by the proof
reading activity of DNA polymerase.
3. DNA polymerase efficiently
discriminates between rNTPs and dNTPs,
because its nucleotide binding pocket
cannot accommodate a 2-OH on the
incoming nucleotide.
4. DNA polymerase cannot discriminate
between rNTPs and dNTPs. Since the
rate of transcription in cell is 106 times
faster than replication, it cannot compete
with RNA polymerase for rNTPs.

84. The mismatch repair activity of E.coli repairs
misincorporated bases which is not removed
by the proofreading activity of DNA
polymerase. However, while doing so, it
has to decide which strand of the DNA is
newly synthesized and which one is parental.
Mismatch repair system does it by which one
of the following ways?
1. It recognizes nearby GATC sequence.
2. It recognizes any nearby palindromic
sequence.
3. It recognises a specific repetitive
sequence.
4. It recognises the hemi-methylated GATC
sequence nearby.

88. A protein has 4 equally spaced trypsin
sensitive sites which results in peptide
fragments A1, A2, A3, A4 and A5 upon
digestion with trypsin. The peptides A2 and
A5 represents N-terminal and C-terminal
fragments respectively. Now you are asked to
synthesise this protein. At time t = 0
you added all the 20 amino acids labelled
with 14C and initiated the synthesis. At
time t = 4, full length protein is synthesized.
If you stop the synthesis of the protein in
time t = 1 and digest the protein with trypsin,
which peptide will have maximum 14C
label than others?

the nuclear receptor superfamily is NOT
true?
1. The receptors are always cytosolic, where
they remain associated with heat-shock
proteins and have variable ligand binding
domains in the N-terminal region.
2. The receptors have characteristic repeat
of the C4 zinc-finger motif
3. The receptors are either homodimeric or
heterodimeric, and in the absence of their
hormone ligand, the heterodimeric
receptors repress transcription, when
bound to their response elements.
4. The receptors have a unique N-terminal
region of variable length and may contain
a nuclear localization signal between the
DNA- and ligand-binding domains.

91. G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) consist
of three protein subunits , β and γ. In
unstimulated state,  subunit is GDP bound
and GPCR is inactive. When GPCR gets
activated, it acts like guanine nucleotide
exchange (GEF) factor and induces -subunit
to release its bound GDP allowing GTP to
bind in its place. In order to regulate Gprotein activity by regulating GDP/GTP
concentration,  subunit acts as

some properties of cell lines and cord blood
stem cells. Cell lines, which are stored in
liquid nitrogen, can be retrieved for
experiments, where they behave as per their
original self. Cord blood can also be retrieved
from liquid nitrogen for procuring stem cells.
Unlike cell lines, the stem cells can be
additionally
induced
to
undergo
differentiation into desired lineages, which
are very different from their original self. The
behaviour of cell lines and stem cells is
analogous to which of the interactions?
1. Both cell lines and stem cells show
instructive interaction
2. Cell lines show instructive interaction
whereas stem cells show permissive
interaction
3. Cell lines show permissive interaction
whereas stem cells show instructive
interaction
4. Both types of cells show permissive

100. In C. elegans, an anchor cell and a few
hypodermal cells take part in the formation of
vulva. The experiments performed to
understand the role of these cells in vulva
formation and the results obtained are as
follows:
- If the anchor cell is killed by laser beam,
hypodermal cells do not participate in
vulva formation and no vulva develops.
- If six hypodermal cells closely located
with anchor cell (called vulval procursor
cells) are killed, no vulva develops.
- If the three central vulval precursors are
destroyed, the three outer cells, which
normally form hypodermis, take the fate
of vulval cells instead.
Following are certain statements regarding
vulva formation:
A. Anchor cell acts as an inducer
B. Six hypodermal cells with the potentiality
to form vulva, form an equivalence group
C. Three, out of six, hypodermal cells participate in vulva formation
D. The central cell functions as the 1 cell
and the two cells on both side act as the
2 cells
E. The 1 cell secretes a short range
juxtacrine signal

142. A researcher is studying the subcellular
localization of a particular protein ‘X’ in an
animal cell. The researcher performs
successive centrifugation at increasing rotor
speed. The researcher starts spinning the
cellular homogenate at 600g for 10 min,
collects the pellet, spins the supernatant at
10,000 g for 20 min, collects the pellet, spins
the supernatant at 100,000g for 1 hour,
collects both the pellet and the final
supernatant. On subjecting various pellets and
the final supernatant to Western blotting with
anti-protein-X antibody, the protein X is
observed to be maximally expressed in pellet

86. In mammals, CG rich sequences are usually
methylated at C, which is a way for marking
genes for silencing. Although the promoters of
housekeeping genes are often associated with
CpG islands yet they are expressed in
mammals. Which one of the following best
explains it?
1. Methylation of cytosine does not prevent the
binding of RNA Pol II with the promoter,
so housekeeping genes are expressed
2. During housekeeping gene expression, the
enzyme methyltransferase is
temporarily silenced by miRNA, thus
shutting down global methylation
3. Unlike within the coding region of a gene,
CG rich sequences present in the promoters
of active genes are usually not methylated
4. As soon as the cytosine is methylated in the
promoter region, the enzymes of DNA
repair pathways remove the methyl group,
thereby ensuring gene expression

97. Driesch performed the famous “pressure plate”
experiment involving intricate recombination
with an 8-celled sea urchin embryo. This
procedure reshuffled the nuclei that normally
would have been in the region destined to form
endoderm into the presumptive ectoderm
region. If segregation of nuclear determinants
had occurred, the resulting embryo should have
been disordered. However, Driesch obtained
normal larvae from these embryos. The possible
interpretations regarding the 8-celled sea urchin
embryo are:
A. The prospective potency of an isolated
blastomere is greater than its actual
prospec tive fate.
B. The prospective potency and the prospective
fate of the blastomere were identical.
C. Sea-urchin embryo is a “harmoniously
equipotential system” because all of its
potentially independent parts interacted
together to form a single embryo.
D. Regulative development occurs where location
of the cell in the embryo determines its fate.

red blood cells (RBCs) of donor blood would
agglutinate but the recipient’s RBCs would be
least affected. These observations can be
explained in the following statements:
A. Agglutinins in recipient’s plasma caused
agglutination by binding with type A
agglutinogens
B. The agglutinins of donor blood was diluted
in recipient’s plasma resulting in low
agglutination

81. You have discovered a new transposon, TnX,
and would like to identify its mode of replication. A heteroduplex of the TnX sequence is
made with a few mismatches and introduced
into bacteria. The newly transposed genomic
loci are sequenced. You find that the sequence
of the transposon matched exactly with one of
its parent strands. This suggests that
1. TnX transposes by conservative
transposition mechanism.
2. TnX transposes using a site-specific
recombination mechanism.
3. single-strands of the duplex are inserted.
4. TnX transposes by replicative mechanism.

85. In all organisms, it is critical that replication
initiation be tightly controlled to ensure that
chromosome number and cell number remain
appropriately balanced. Given below are
several statements regarding regulation of
replication in E. coli.
A. Hemimethylation and sequestration of
oriC (origin of replication) by a protein
called SeqA prevents initiation of
replication.
B. Availability of DnaA protein is an
important requirement for initiation of
replication.
C. The ratio of ADP : ATP is important as
high level of ADP is required for initiation
of replication.
D. Recruitment of Hda protein by sliding
clamp inhibits ATP hydrolysis required
for initiation of replication.
Which of the above statements are NOT
true?

87. tRNA genes of a Gram positive bacteria were
sequenced. While some of the genes
possessed sequence corresponding to the
–CCA end of the tRNA, others did not.
Interestingly, even the genes that lacked the
sequence corresponding to the –CCA end of
the tRNA were found to code for a functional
tRNA. This is because
1. the –CCA end in the tRNA is not essential
for its function.
2. the genes that do not possess sequence
corresponding to the –CCA ends of the
tRNA are repaired prior to their
transcription.
3. the –CCA end is added to the tRNA
during their maturation.
4. the primary transcripts of the genes lacking
sequence corresponding to the – CCA end
are subjected to g-RNA mediated editing
prior to their maturation.

89. In a type of signal transduction pathway,
ligand binding to a receptor triggers
activation of a receptor-associated kinase.
This kinase may be an intrinsic part of the
receptor protein or tightly bound to the
receptor. Receptors in which the tyrosine
kinase is an intrinsic part of it’s polypeptide
chain are called the receptor tyrosine kinase
(RTK). Which one of the following
statements regarding RTK is INCORRECT?
1. All RTKs have three essential components:
an extracellular domain containing ligand
binding site, a transmembrane domain and
a cytoplasmic segment that includes a
domain with protein tyrosine kinase activity.
2. Most RTKs are monomeric and ligand
binding to the extracellular domain
induces formation of receptor dimers.
3. All cytokine receptors belong to RTKs
and cytokine binding activates tyrosine
kinase and receptor dimerization.
4. Ligand binding to RTK leads to autophosphorylation of the protein tyrosine kinase in the
cytoplasmic domain. The activated kinase
then phosphorylates several tyrosine residues
in the receptor’s cytoplasmic domain.

101. A specific Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase
(MAPK) cascade comprising MEKK1(a
MAP3K), MKK1 (a MAP2K) and MPK6 (a
MAPK) is activated sequentially in that
order in Arabidopsis plants upon perceiving
certain abiotic stress stimuli. The activated
MPK6 phosphorylates and activates a
transcription factor ‘X’, thereby making
plant tolerant to the abiotic stress. Two
different variants of MKK1 protein, a kinase
inactive (KI) and a constitutively active
(CA) forms were expressed independently in
mkk1 mutant Arabidopsis plant. Considering

identified in a plant. The wild type phenotype
is late ripening (LR). Further DNA marker(s)
is/are observed to be polymorphic between
EL and LR plants. A cross was made
between pure lines of LR and ER. The F1
progeny was test crossed and its progeny was
analyzed. The parental, F1 and progeny of
test cross were also analyzed for the DNA
marker. The table below summarizes the
phenotype of the progeny and the pattern of
DNA marker observed in each case:

Based on the above information, the
following statements were made:
A. LR is dominant to ER
B. The DNA marker used is a dominant marker

116. In Burkitt’s Lymphoma a reciprocal translocation between chromosome 8 and 14 is
observed. If an individual is heterozygous for
this translocation, the consequence in meiosis
will be as follows:
A. Four chromosomes, i.e., normal chromosome 8 and 14, and translocated
chromosome 8 and 14, pair together
B. The two normal chromosomes 8 and 14,
and two translocated chromosomes pair
separately
C. All gametes produced from this meiosis
are non-viable as they have deletions and
duplications
D. In one of the cross configurations called
"alternate segregation" all gametes having
normal or translocated chromosomes,
survive
E. The gametes having normal chromosomes
only survive while all gametes having
translocated chromosomes are non-viable,
hence the translocations are used as
crossover suppressors

134. When James R Brown and W Ford Doolittle
(1997) reconstructed the tree of life using a
variety of different genes, they found that
different genes gave fundamentally different
phylogenies as shown below. Note that the
genes are unique to the specific trees.

135. Orchids of the genus Cryptostylis are known
to maintain reproductive isolation because
their flowers look and smell like females of
the wasps of genus Lissopimpla. When the
male wasp visits and attempts to mate with
the flower, the shape of anther and stigma
allows correct placement and transfer of
pollen to the wasp, which then transfers the
pollen to species specific flower that it next
attempts to mate with. This prezygotic barrier
that prevents inter-species cross-pollination
in Cryptostylis is best explained by:
1. behavioural isolation through mimicry
2. mechanical isolation through mimicry
3. temporal isolation
4. habitat isolation

coding sequence of a gene downstream to a
bacterial promoter (500bp in length) for over
expression and purification of the encoded
protein. The gene sequence was isolated as a
SmaI fragment (Recognition sequence:
CCCGGG; arrow indicates the site of
restriction) and cloned at a SmaI site located
downstream to the promoter. The gene
sequence contained a single site for EcoRI
located 30bp downstream to the start codon.
A schematic representation of the plasmid
along with locations(s) of some restriction
enzyme sites of the vector is given below.

137. You are studying the binding of proteins to the cytoplasmic face of cultured liver cells and have found a method
that gives a good yield of inside-out vesicles from the plasma membrane. Unfortunately, your preparations are
contaminated with variable amounts of right-side-out vesicles. Nothing you have tried avoids this contamination.
Somebody suggests that you pass the vesicles over an affinity column made of lectin coupled to Sepharose beads.
What is the rational of this suggestion?
a. Right-side-out-vesicles will be lysed by lectin coupled to Sepharose beads.
b. Right-side-out-vesicles will simply bind to the lectin coupled Sepharose beads.
c. Lectin will bind to the carbohydrate residues present only on the inside out vesicles.
d. Lectin will bind to only glycoproteins and glycolipids present on the inside out vesicles.

143. Insertion lambda vectors are used to create cDNA libraries. In some insertion vectors, the site of insertion is
within the cI gene. The recombinants which are cI can then be screened by plating on E. coli hfl. The gene hfl
encodes a protease that controls lytic-lysogeny decision through which mechanism?

26

June 2011
a. Hfl protease degrades cI, thereby promoting lytic pathway.
b. Hfl protease degrades cIII and so cIII cannot interact, with cII. The lysogenic pathway is thus preferred.
c. Hfl protease degrades cII, and therefore cI synthesis cannot be established, thus lytic pathway is preferred.
d. Hfl protease degrades INT, the protein involved in phage integration and the lytic pathway is initiated.

144. A 30-residue peptide was treated with trypsin and the tryptic peptides were separated by HPLC. Four peaks A,

Explanations
001. Given that, net worth = 99 crores and profit = 10%.
Let the principle value be y, then net worth = y + y × 10%
99 = (1.1)y.
So, y = 90.
Hence, the principle value is 90.
009. Disorder Y may occur by itself or through disorder X. 4% incidence of disorder Y gives information that there is
less than 4% of population which is suffered from X disorder.
010. The amount of water in flask A and B is lesser than in flask C. So, pressure will be maximum at flask C in comparison
to A and B flask. So, dripping of water i.e. the rate of the fall of the volume of water in flask C is fastest.
012. As we know that ice is bad conductor of heat. So, in polar region temperature of the ocean surface is approximately
equal to 0°C and with increasing depth, its temperature must be equal to 0°C.

Time (hours)

To find the length of the cell cycle, select any two points on the graph in the above figure, between which the
number of cells has doubled. The time separating those two points is the length of the cell cycle. For example, the
first two data points in figure are at 3 × 105 cells (10 hours) and 6 × 105 cells (30 hours). Since the population
of mouse L cells doubled in 20 hours (30 hours – 10 hours), the length of the cell cycle is 20 hours.
047. The siRNA pathway begins with cleavage of long dsRNA by the Dicer enzyme complex into siRNA. These siRNAs
are incorporated into Argonaute 2 (AGO2) and the RNAi-induced silencing complex (RISC). If the RNA duplex
loaded onto RISC has perfect sequence complementarity, AGO2 cleaves the passenger (sense) strand so that
active RISC containing the guide (antisense) strand is produced. The siRNA guide strand recognizes target sites
to direct mRNA cleavage by the catalytic domain of AGO2.
The miRNA pathway begins with endogenously encoded primary miRNAs that are transcribed by RNA polymerase
II and are processed by the Drosha enzyme complex to yield precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs). These precursors
are then exported to the cytoplasm and subsequently bind to the Dicer enzyme complex, which processes the
pre-miRNA for loading onto the Argonaute 2–RISC complex. When the RNA duplex loaded onto RISC has imperfect
sequence complementarity, the passenger (sense) strand is unwound leaving a mature miRNA bound to active RISC.
The mature miRNA recognizes target sites (typically in the 3’-UTR) in the mRNA, leading to direct translational
inhibition. Binding of miRNA to target mRNA may also lead to mRNA target degradation in processing.

048. TATA-binding protein (TBP) appears to be essential for all transcription in eukaryotic cell nuclei, which suggests
that its function was established early in evolution. Archaebacteria constitute a kingdom of organisms distinct
from eukaryotes and eubacteria. Archaebacterial gene regulatory sequences often map to TATA box-like motifs.
Here it is shown that the archaebacterium Pyrococcus woesei expresses a protein with structural and functional
similarity to eukaryotic TBP molecules.
Source: Science, (1994, 264:5163, 1326-1329)
Recognition of the TATA box is conferred by the TATA-binding protein (TBP), a small protein of ~30 kD. TBP
has the unusual property of binding to DNA in the minor groove. TBP associated with TAFs are responsible for
identifying all classes of promoters regardless of their TATA content - TFIID (for pol II promoters), TFIIIB (for pol
III promoters) and SL1 (for pol I promoters).
Source: Gene X by Benjamin Lewin
061. Nuclear receptors (such as retinoic acid receptors) consist of five to six structural and functional domains denoted
A to F. The evolutionarily conserved DNA-binding domains (DBDs) and ligand-binding domains (LBDs) are
schematically represented by cylinders. The DBD is composed of two zinc-finger motifs and mediates sequencespecific DNA recognition. Transcriptional regulation is mainly mediated by the multifunctional LBD, which contains
a ligand-binding pocket, a dimerization surface and a ligand-dependent transcriptional activation function (AF-2).
The divergent regions are represented as thin tubes. The N-terminal A/B region contains a ligand-independent
activation function (AF-1), the short D region corresponds to a linker allowing the proper orientation of DBDs and
LBDs within DNA-bound dimers and finally the C-terminal F domain, which is present in RARs but not in RXRs and
for which no clear function has been assigned. The activation domains (ADs) contain transcriptional activation
functions that can activate transcription when fused to a heterologous DBD.

115. Statements and options are not related.
Two models of community organization are common: the bottom-up model and the top-down model. Bottom-up
model postulates a unidirectional influence from lower to higher trophic levels. In this case, the presence or absence
of mineral nutrients controls plant numbers, which control herbivore numbers, which in turn control predator numbers.
In contrast, the top-down model postulates the opposite. Predation mainly controls community organization because
predators limit herbivores, herbivores limit plants, and plants limit nutrient levels through their uptake of nutrients
during growth and reproduction. The simplified top-down model is also called the trophic cascade model.

It means that out of 100 fruitflies of exactly 4 mm length we are confident that 95 of them are derived from
fruitflies of lengths between 4.0196 mm and 3.9804 mm. The other 5 are probably outside these limits.
So, total number of fruitflies whose length is beyond the limit of upper and lower estimate = 0.05 × 400 = 20.
Hence, the number of fruitflies whose length is greater than 4.4 mm = 20/2 = 10.

81. Influenza virus (IV), a well known enveloped
animal virus, enters its host cells through
membrane fusion process catalyzed by
haemagluttinin (HA) protein inside endosomes
at 37C. HA is localized in the lipid bilayer
membrane of the IV as an integral membrane
protein and is responsible for binding and
fusion of IV membraneत withत the endosomal
membrane of host cells. Upon binding, IV is
internalized into host cells through receptor
mediated endocytosis followed by fusion of
the IV membrane with endosome membrane
catalyzed by HA. In a situation, if we wish to
fuse IV membrane with its host cells (deficient
in endocytosis) at the plasma membrane,
mention the correct condition out of the
following:
1. Pre-treat IV in pH 5.0 followed by its
binding and fusion with host cells at pH
7.4 and 37C.
2. Allow the IV to bind and fuse with host
cells at pH 7.4 and 37C.
3. IV and host cells are allowed to bind
and fuse at pH 5.0 and 37C.
4. IV is subjected to incubation at 60C for
30 minutes and allowed to bind and
fuse with host cells at pH 5.0 and 37C.

83. Each aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase is precisely
able to match an amino acid with the tRNA
containing
the
correct
corresponding
anticodon. Most organisms have 20 different
tRNA synthetases, however some bacteria
lack the synthetase for charging the tRNA for
glutamine (tRNAGln) with its cognate amino
acid. How do these bacteria manage to
incorporate glutamine in their proteins?
Choose the correct answer.
1. Glutamine is not present in the newly
synthesized bacterial protein. Post translationalतmodification converts glutamate to
glutamine at the required sites.
2. In these bacteria, the aminoacyl tRNA
synthetase specific for tRNA glutamate
(tRNAglu) also charges tRNAgln with
glutamine.
3. In these bacteria, the aminoacyl tRNA
synthetase specific for tRNAglu also charges
tRNAgln with glutamate. A second enzyme
then converts the glutamate of the charged
tRNAgln to glutamine.
4. In these bacteria, the aminoacyl tRNA
synthetase charges tRNAglu with either
glutamate or glutamine according to their
requirement during protein synthesis.

84. As topoisomerases play an important role
during replication, a large number of
anticancer drugs have been developed that
inhibit the activity of these enzymes. Which of
the following statements is NOT true about
topoisomerases as a potential anticancer drug
target?
1. As cancer cells are rapidly growing cells,
they usually contain higher level of
topoisomerases.
2. The transient DNA breaks created by
topoisomerases are usually converted to
permanent breaks in the genome in the
presence of topoisomerase targeted drugs.
3. As cancer cells often have impaired DNA
repair pathways, they are more susceptible
towards topoisomerase targeted drugs.
4. The drugs which specifically target
topoisomerases, usually do not affect
normal fast growing cells.

87. An eukaryotic cell undergoing mRNA
synthesis and processing was incubated with
32
P labelled ATP, with the label at the position. Where do you think the radioactive
isotope will appear in the mature mRNA?
1. 32P will not appear in the mature mRNA
under any circumstances because  and 
phosphates are released during
transcription.
2. Phosphate groups of the phoshodiester
backbone of the mRNA will be uniformly
labelled as only  phosphates are released
during transcription.
3. 32P will appear at the 5' end of the mRNA if
only it has “A” as the first nucleotide.
4. No 32P will appear in the mature mRNA
because the 5'-terminal phosphate of an
“A” residue will be further removed during
the capping process.

88. One of the cellular events that TOR, a kinase,
positively regulates is the rate of rRNA
synthesis. TOR regulates the association of a
transcription factor to a Pol I subunit. When
TOR is inhibited by the drug rapamycin, the
transcription factor dissociates from Pol I. A
yeast strain is engineered, which expresses a
fusion of the transcription factor and the Pol I
subunit. The level of rRNA synthesis is
monitored in these cells usingत pulse labelling
following rapamycin addition for the times
indicated below. The transcript profile of
rRNA observed for the wild type cells is given
below:

91. Cadherins mediate Ca2+-dependent cell-cell
adhesion and play an important role in
embryonic development by changing the
adhesive properties of cell. Aggregation of
nerve cells to form an epithelium is correlated
with the appearance of N-cadherins on cell
surface and vice versa. N-CAM (neural cell
adhesion molecules) belongs to Ig-SF
(immunoglobulin super family) and involved
in fine tuning of adhesive interactions. In
order to see the effect of mutations of Ncadherin and N-CAM, two sets of mice were
generated. Set A - mice with mutation in Ncadherin and set B - mice with mutation in NCAM. Which of the following results is most
likely to occur?
1. Mice of both set A and set B will die in
early development.
2. Mice of set A will die in early development
but mice of set B will develop normally
and show mild abnormalities in the
development of nervous system.
3. Mice of Set A will show mild abnormalities
in the development of nervous system
whereas mice of set B will die early in
development.
4. Mice of both set A and set B develop
normally as other cell adhesion molecules
will compensate for the mutations.

92. A virus infects a particular cell type, integrates
its genome into a site that contains a protooncogene, transforms the cell and increases
the level of a protein ‘X’, which increases
cellular proliferation. A compound ‘P’ is
known to increase the level of tumor
suppressor proteins in that cell type whereas a
compound ‘Q’ helps in stimulatingत a protein
‘Z’ that can bind to ‘X’ rendering it inactive.

https://pathfinderacademy.in/

26
1. Stem cells do not divide and therefore
require fewer changes to become a cancer
cell.
2. Cancer stem cells can self-renew as well as
generate the non-stem cell populations of
the tumor.

103. The following statements are made to describe
auxin signal transduction pathway, from
receptor binding to the physiological response:
A. Auxin response factors (ARFs) are nuclear
proteins that bind to auxin response
elements (Aux REs) to activate or repress
gene transcription.
B. AUX/IAA proteins are secondary regulators
of auxin-induced gene expression. Binding
of AUX/IAA proteins to the ARF protein
blocks its transcription regulation.

108. The membrane potential in a giant squid axon
recorded intracellularly at the resting condition
(-70 mV) was reversed at the peak of action
potential (+35 mV) after stimulation of the
nerve fibre with a threshold electrical
stimulus. This overshoot of the membrane
potential has been explained in the following
proposed statements:
A. The rapid increase in Na+-conductance
during early phase of action potential
causes membrane potential to move toward
the equilibrium potential of Na+ (+45 mV).
B. The Na+ -conductance quickly decreases
toward resting level after peak in the
early phase and Na+-ions are not able to
attain its equilibrium potential within this
short time.
C. The conductance of K+ at the early phase of
action potential is increased and thatत leads
to the reversal of membrane potential.
D. The increase of K+ - conductance due to
stimulation of nerve occurs before the
changes of Na+ - conductance is initiated
and thus causes overshoot at the peak of
action potential.

117. A male mouse cell line has a large
translocation from X chromosome into
chromosome 1. When a GFP containing
transgene is inserted in this chromosome 1
with translocation, it is often silenced.
However when inserted in the other
homologue of chromosome 1 that does not
contain the translocation, it is almost always
expressed. Which
of the
following
phenomenon best describes this effect?
1. Genome imprinting
2. Gene balance
3. Sex-specific expression
4. Dosage compensation

139. In an effort to produce gene knockout mice, a
gene targeted homologous recombination was
tried with the exogenous DNA containing
gene (confer G-418 resistance) and
gene (confers sensitivity to the
cytotoxic nucleotide analog ganciclovir). If
the
gene was inserted within the target
gene in the exogenous DNA and considering
that both homologous and non-homologous
recombination (random integration) is taking
place, which one of the following statements
is NOT correct about the possible outcome of
the experiment?
1. Cells with non-homologous insertion will
be sensitive to ganciclovir.
2. Non-recombinant cells will be sensitive
towards G-418 and resistant to ganciclovir.
3. Homologous recombination will ensure
that cells will be resistant to both
ganciclovir and G-418.
4. Homologous recombinants will grow in G418 containing media but will be
sensitive towards ganciclovir.

143. Radioimmuno assay (RIA) can be employed
for the detection of insulin in blood plasma.
For this, 125I-labelled insulin is mixed and
allowed to bind with a known concentration of
anti-insulin antibody. A known volume of
patients’ blood plasma is then added to the
conjugate and allowed to compete with the
antigen binding sites of antibody. The bound
antigen is then separated from unbound ones
and the radioactivity of free antigen is then
measured by gamma counter. Following are
some of the statements made about this assay.
(i) The ratio of radioactive count for
unbound antigen to the bound one is
more at the end of reaction.
(ii) The ratio of radioactive count for
unbound antigen to the bound one is
less at the end of reaction.
(iii) For a diabetic patient, the radioactive
count for free antigen is less than that for
a normal individual.
(iv) For a diabetic patient, the radioactive
count for free antigen is more than that
for a normal individual.
