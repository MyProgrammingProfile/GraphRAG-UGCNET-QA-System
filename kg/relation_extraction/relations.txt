under extreme temperatures, drought, or rapid changes in light intensities, etc can give rise to the production of different forms of reactive oxygen species (ros), which can damage proteins, membranes and dna.2 the rapid adaptation (on the timescale ranging from seconds to a few minutes) of etc to varying environmental conditions is, therefore, essential for the sustainable development of photosynthetic organisms and their survival under inclement environment conditions.3-5

at the level of etc, the adjustments of electron transport in response to rapid environmental changes are achieved by cooperation of several short-term photoprotective mechanisms, which include: (i) “state transitions,” i.e. optimization of light absorption between psi and psii achieved upon phosphorylation and association of the so-called ‘mobile pool’ of lhcii with either psi or psii6-8; (ii) “alternative electron transport routes,” i.e., redistribution of electron fluxes through different alternative pathways, including cyclic electron transport (cet) mediated by either the nadh dehydrogenase-like (ndh) complex or the prg5-pgrl1 protein complex9-11; (iii) “non photochemical quenching (npq),” i.e. ph-dependent dissipation of excess energy in the lhcii to protect the photosynthetic apparatus against photooxidation12-14; (iv) “photosynthesis control,” i.e., regulation of electron transport by the cyt b6f complex, governed by the ph of thylakoid lumen and stroma.15-18
